#2) PROTECT YOUR ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS

While your device itself should be protected (#1 above), the communications and information traveling from your devices over the Internet also must be protected from 
cyber risk. Banking, shopping, emailing, browsing – without protection, anything done over the Internet is easily viewed, collected, and potentially used against you
either then, at another time in the future, or potentially both.
Risks –

Snooping and sniffing – spying

Location tracking

Fake WiFi hotspots

Consequences –

Loss of passwords and account information

Financial fraud and ID theft
Physical harm

Extortion and blackmail

Data and information theft

Solutions –

Encryption

Private, Off-Grid Networks
 
 #3) PRIVATIZE YOUR EMAIL SERVICE

No one looks for reasons to change their email, but for many with “free” accounts like Gmail, AOL, Yahoo, and others, are realizing it is becoming more inevitable every time they get hacked. Private email accounts are operated away from the honeypots of the giant “free” providers, and don’t resell your information for a profit.

Risks – 

Phishing and spear-phishing

Social engineering

Metadata loss

Information theft

Consequences –

Financial fraud

Identity theft

Reputational risk

Extortion and blackmail

Solutions –

Privately operated services

Spam engines

Preemptive virus screening

“Gatekeeping” and “Fingerprinting” controls

#4) BACKUP AND ENCRYPT YOUR IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS AND DATA
Cloud-based backup services are easy and cheap, and the convenience is great, but there is risk of loss and theft. Sensitive information like financial and legal documents, healthcare records and tax returns, scans of passports and other sensitive identification – all should be held off the cloud, and doubly encrypted when stored and shared over the Internet.

Risks –

Cloud-based servers

Online theft

Unsecure networks

Unsecure sharing, sending, and receiving

Digital assets held in intestate 

Consequences –

Permanent loss of records

Financial, tax, and insurance fraud

ID theft

Blackmail and extortion

Estate probate and litigation in case of death 

Solutions –

Off-cloud storage

Encryption end-to-end

Secure apps
